## Goals for today

1. Introduce you to some key ideas in environmental economics.

2. Show you some of the stuff that I am working on.

3. Answer any questions that you might have.

# Some questions

---

## How much is a polar bear worth?

---

## Is it good to "buy local"?

---

## If fighting pollution is expensive, can we have too little pollution?

## Common-pool resources game

(We'd normally do this live, in class. But [here's a game](https://economics-games.com/tragedy-commons) for you try in groups once you watch this lesson. After that, watch the short video below to get deeper sense of what's happening...)

## Motivation for the project

- You are about to lose access to your preferred fishing ground. 
  - Someone is about to take away all your fish / eat the rest of the birthday cake / etc.

- What do you do?

--

- My answer: "Catch all the fish while I still can!"

---

## Global Fishing Watch

- GFW is a joint project started by Google and some non-profit organisations.

- Offers unprecedented insight into *global* fishing activity.
  - Includes otherwise inaccessible locations.
  
- GFW want to encourage citizen science and engagement. Anyone can look at the GFW data through their ([interactive map](http://globalfishingwatch.org/map/)).
  - Fun fact: The graphics technology used to power the map is the same used in leading video games like *World of Warcraft*, etc.

---

## A lot of data...

## Cool use of machine learning

## Back to the Blue Paradox

- Focus on the Phoenix Island Protected Area (PIPA).
  - A big marine reserve in the central Pacific, about the size of California!

## Summary

- Fishermen more than *doubled* their fishing effort in the lead up to PIPA.
  - Equivalent to 1.5 years of banned fishing.

- Even well-intentioned policies can lead to bad outcomes.
  - Especially if we ignore human behaviour and incentives... the role of economics!

---

## Other, ongoing GFW projects

- There are numerous other, ongoing GFW projects that I'd be happy to talk about afterwards.

  - E.g. Connecting overfishing and human-rights abuses on the high seas. ([Link](https://globalfishingwatch.org/research/forced-labor-in-fisheries/).)

- FWIW, here's a GEE script for the <a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/21c101d3d1aa7a5ac083c9bd6cd19f8c" target="_blank">Blue Paradox</a> using GFW data.
